# img-histogram-gen
This program breaks the image into 1296 blocks and 5 regions and generates histograms to each block. After that, each histogram block becomes words that can be used as terms in a vector model. So that, it can be used together with a vector model to do CBIR (Content Based Information Retrieval).
